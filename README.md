QlikView Utilization Planner Extension
================================================================================
A QlikView extension object that uses D3.js to draw an interactive bar chart for scheduling at a weekly level. The chart allows you to enter paramaters such as the number of hours already completed, the number of hours left to be distributed across a 40 hour work week, the starting date, and the total hour capacity used for a utilization rate calculation. The bars can be moved up and down by clicking and dragging on their edges.
